# Backend specific files not meant for version control
# If your daily_puzzles.json is generated or frequently updated by the app
# and you don't want to track its changes in Git, you might add it.
# However, if it contains the base data for your puzzle, you might want to keep it tracked.
# For now, I'll assume you want to track it, as it's the source of your puzzles.
# If you decide not to track it:
# daily_puzzles.json

# If you use ngrok, its config might be generated
.ngrok2/

# Any other temporary or build-related files
# For example, if you later add a build step for your frontend:
